Recursion:
Questions:
1.	What is a potential consequence of not including a base case in a recursive function?
	It would result in an infinite loop
2.	What does memoization allow you to avoid?
That a method would not run for the same inputs more than once

3.	What are the steps to writing a recursive function?
●	Create a regular function with a base case that can be reached with its parameters.
●	Pass arguments into the function that immediately trigger the base case.
●	Pass the next arguments that trigger the recursive call just once.

Linked Lists: 
Questions:
1.	Why would we use a Linked List instead of an array?
Linked lists are more flexible and adaptable and are best suited for situations where the size of the collection is not known.
2.	When we want to add a node to a linked list, do we have to scoot over the subsequent nodes (like we do for arrays)?
No, To append a node to a non-empty linked list, make the last node link to the new node. Unlike arrays, we cannot access any elements in a linked list directly. We must traverse from the head node to the last node.
3.	Can we do index access like we can with arrays with linked lists?
No, we cannot access any elements in a linked list directly

Questions: 
1.	Why do we create tests?
It aims to validate that each code unit is working as intended and to catch any bugs or errors early in the development process before they become more challenging to fix



2.	What is automated testing?
 A software testing technique that automates the process of validating the functionality of software and ensures it meets requirements before being released into production.
3.	What is TDD?
 A software development practice that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code.
